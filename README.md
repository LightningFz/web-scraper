# web-scraper

This project entails the development of a fundamental web scraping tool designed to extract specific data from a 
designated website. In this case, the target website is https://gamedevbeginner.com/. The primary objective of this 
web scraper is to retrieve both the topic headlines and the corresponding links associated with them.

To achieve this, JavaScript has been employed as the programming language of choice. Additionally, this project leverages
the capabilities of Node.js, which is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. Node.js provides 
a robust and efficient foundation for building web scraping applications, allowing for the seamless retrieval and processing 
of data from web pages.

In summary, this is a web scraping endeavor that harnesses the power of JavaScript and Node.js to extract topic headlines 
and their corresponding links from the specified website, https://gamedevbeginner.com/. It represents a practical example 
of how modern web scraping techniques can be employed to gather data from the web efficiently and effectively.
